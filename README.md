> Below is the obsolete documentation.

**Please read this first:** 

* This project is still under development. We would recommend you to try this project on Ethereum `Ropsten Test Network` instead of `Main Ethereum Network`, because using Ribbit on `Ropsten Test Network` is completely free of charge, and we might deploy new smart contract in the future and deprecate the old one. We might also make changes to the smart contract on `Ropsten Test Network`, so your posts might lose. Please use this project at your own risk.  
* You are responsible for whatever you post. Think twice before you make a post because your post will stay on the blockchain **forever**. It is unchangeable and undeletable. All your posts will stay **public** on blockchain, so please don't post sensitive data.
* We do not host media files for you. We only save your text written in `markdown` to Ethereum blockchain.

## Usage

1.  Install [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) in your Chrome browser and launch it. Follow the MetaMask instructions and create an account.
2.  Switch to `Ropsten Test Network`. Visit the faucet website listed below and request test ethers. Don't worry, they are fake ether coins.
	* http://faucet.ropsten.be:3001/ and click `request 1 ether from faucet`.
	* https://faucet.metamask.io/ and click `Send me 1 test ether!`
3.  Visit http://shd101wyy.github.io/ribbit/ to start using ribbit. The first time you visit ribbit website, it will ask you to finish a signup. Simply finish the form and then click `Publish profile to blockchain` button to create your account. Wait for a few minutes until the transaction finishes, then refresh your browser.

> You may notice the `MetaMask` window pops up when you click `Publish profile to blockchain` button, that is because writing data to blockchain isn't free. You would have to pay for the miner to execute the transaction. You only need to change the `Gas Price` field in the MetaMask window. The higher `Gas Price` you set, the faster the transaction will be executed.
